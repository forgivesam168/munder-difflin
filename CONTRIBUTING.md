# Contributing to Munder Difflin

Thanks for your interest! This is an early prototype, so there's a lot of surface
area and plenty of room to help. This guide covers setup, the gotchas, and the
conventions that keep the codebase coherent.

## Code of Conduct

This project follows the [Contributor Covenant](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By
participating, you agree to uphold it.

## Before you start

These are the constraints most pull requests trip over. Reading them first is
much cheaper than finding out in review.

- **Keep the change scoped to one clear improvement, fix, or refactor.** A fix
  plus a rename plus a refactor is three pull requests, and all three merge
  faster than the one.
- **Munder Difflin targets macOS, Windows and Linux.** Every change has to work
  on all three unless it sits behind an explicit runtime platform check. Most
  of our cross-platform bugs are paths: use `path.join` and the Node path
  helpers, never a hand-built `"a/b"` string.
- **Paths with spaces are real.** Several shipped bugs came from a hive folder
  living under a directory with a space in its name. Quote, and test one.
- **We support twelve agent CLIs and counting.** Keep shared behaviour provider
  neutral and put provider specific logic behind an explicit check. Anything
  that assumes Claude Code specifically will break the other eleven.
- **Do not assume the local machine.** Agents run against their own working
  directories and their own environments; a process, file, credential or shell
  that exists on yours may not exist on theirs.
- **New UI derives from the design tokens.** [`DESIGN.md`](./DESIGN.md) is
  canonical. No ad-hoc colors, spacing or fonts.

## Development setup

### Prerequisites

- **macOS, Windows, or Linux** — signed/notarized macOS builds, plus Windows and
  Linux builds, ship from the [releases page](https://github.com/chaitanyagiri/munder-difflin/releases/latest).
  Cross-platform smoke-testing and fixes are still very welcome (see
  [Good first areas](#good-first-areas)).
- **Node.js 22.14+** and npm; CI uses Node.js 24. SQLite requires Node-API 10.
- A **C/C++ toolchain** when rebuilding native addons (macOS/Linux or explicit
  source builds; normal Windows x64 setup uses verified prebuilds). On macOS:
  ```bash
  xcode-select --install
  ```
  On Windows/Linux, follow [`node-pty`'s own prerequisites](https://github.com/microsoft/node-pty#dependencies).
- **[Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)** on your `PATH` if you want
  agents to actually run `claude` (the default command). Any other command works.

### Install & run

```bash
git clone <your-fork-url> munder-difflin
cd munder-difflin
npm install        # postinstall validates/rebuilds native dependencies for the host
npm run dev        # live-reloading Electron build
```

The research dependency set uses Electron 43 and better-sqlite3 13. SQLite ships
platform prebuilds; Windows postinstall validates both native bindings and applies
the PTY lifecycle guards without requiring a compiler. Other platforms retain
the node-pty rebuild for Electron. Electron's
binary is downloaded on first CLI use (or explicitly with `npx install-electron`).
For controlled installs, acquire packages with `npm ci --ignore-scripts`, inspect
the lifecycle effects, then run the required native setup separately. Set
`TUNNELMOLE_TELEMETRY=0` in the installation environment to disable its install
telemetry; CI and release builds set this explicitly.

This research branch also normalizes Tunnelmole 2.4.0's redundant self-dependency
metadata during setup. The version-checked helper invalidates only npm's generated
`node_modules/.package-lock.json` cache; the root lockfile retains registry
provenance. Packaging reapplies normalization after dependency preparation and
before collection. For standalone dependency inspection after an npm operation,
run `node tools/patch-tunnelmole-metadata.cjs` first.
Hono is explicit and WebSocket 8 is an explicit optional dependency to keep the
MCP/OpenAI dependency graph complete under npm 11.6.2; Tunnelmole retains its
separate WebSocket 7. These entries resolve observed missing/invalid dependencies,
not additional application features. Verify with
`npm list -a --include prod --include optional --omit dev` after installation;
an install exit code alone did not catch this failure.

`npm run dist:win` and the Windows release job select `electron-builder.win.yml`.
This Windows x64 profile validates the prebuilds without a compiler and retains
automatic production dependency copying. Other targets use the base
`electron-builder.yml` rebuild path, including each macOS universal slice.
Generic `npm run dist` also uses that base configuration; on Windows use
`dist:win` for the verified prebuild path. The Windows profile rejects unsupported
host/target combinations and `npm_config_build_from_source=true`; use the base
configuration for an explicit source build, which remains unverified in this POC.
Verify the packaged executable and its own native dependencies with
`node tools/research-run.cjs test/native-modules.electron.test.cjs <win-unpacked-dir>`.
This test does not start the full application or establish release readiness.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The most common setup failure is the native `node-pty` rebuild.** The
> Source-build setup uses `electron-rebuild`. If you see a "wrong ELF/Mach-O"
> or "NODE_MODULE_VERSION" error, verify the host/target architecture and rerun
> native setup. Source-build paths also require the platform C/C++ toolchain.

## Evidence is mandatory

**Every pull request must show a before and an after.** Screenshots, or a screen
recording when the thing moves. They go in the PR description, under the
`### Before` and `### After` headings the template gives you.

This is enforced. The `PR evidence` check runs the moment you open a PR, and a
PR that fails it does not merge. Fix the description and the check re-runs on
save. It reads each heading separately, so two images dumped under one of them
will not pass — a reviewer has to be able to tell which is which.

**"My change has no UI" is not an exemption.** It changes the evidence, not the
requirement:

| Kind of change | What before/after looks like |
|---|---|
| Visual | The same view, twice. Same window size, same theme, same data. |
| Bug fix | The bug happening, then the same steps not producing it. |
| Terminal / CLI | A recording of the session, or the output pasted as text. |
| Performance | The measurement before and the measurement after, same machine. |
| Crash / hang | The failure, then the same path completing. |
| Test-only | The suite red, then the suite green. |

Make the two shots comparable. Different window sizes, a light shot against a
dark one, or different data means the reviewer is diffing your screenshots
instead of your change.

The only way out is the `no-visual-change` label, which a maintainer applies
for things with genuinely nothing observable: a CI tweak, a typo, a dependency
bump. You cannot add it yourself, and asking for it on a change that does
something visible will cost you more time than the screenshot would have.

## Before you open a PR

1. **Attach the before and after.** See above. This is the one that gets PRs
   closed unread, so do it first, not last.
2. **Keep the type-checker green:** `npm run typecheck` (runs both the node and
   web TS projects).
3. **Run the tests:** `npm run test:focused`. If you changed behaviour, add a
   test for it — a bug fix with no test is a bug fix that comes back.
4. **Confirm a production build works:** `npm run build`.
5. **Match the aesthetic.** Any new UI **must** derive from the design tokens in
   [`DESIGN.md`](./DESIGN.md) / `src/renderer/src/design/tokens.ts` — no ad-hoc
   colors, spacing, or fonts. `tokens.ts` and `tokens.css` are mirrored; if you
   change one, change both.
6. **Read your own diff.** Every line of it. Debug logging, commented-out code,
   and reformatting of files you didn't otherwise touch all get a PR sent back.
7. **Run your coding agent over your own PR, and paste what it found.** We ship
   an agent harness; use one. Ask it to check specifically for cross-platform
   behaviour, paths with spaces, whether the change stays provider neutral
   across the supported CLIs, performance in hot paths, and obvious security
   risk. A short honest summary including what it flagged and you decided not to
   change is worth more than a clean one, and it usually saves a review round
   trip. This is asked for, not required.

## Where the bar is

We get more pull requests than we can review carefully, so the bar is high and
it is easier for everyone if it is written down. Clear the list above and you
are almost certainly fine. The items below are the ones we close rather than
negotiate, and every one of them is cheaper to avoid than to fix in review:

- **No before/after evidence**, and no `no-visual-change` label.
- **More than one change in one PR.** A fix plus a refactor plus a rename is
  three PRs. Split it and every one of them merges faster.
- **Wholesale reformatting** of files, or a diff where the real change is buried
  in whitespace and import reordering.
- **A rewrite nobody asked for.** Large architectural changes need an issue or a
  [discussion](https://github.com/chaitanyagiri/munder-difflin/discussions) with
  agreement **before** you write the code. We would rather say no to a paragraph
  than to a week of your work.
- **Generated or unattributed content** — art that isn't yours or compatibly
  licensed, or a description that doesn't match what the diff does.
- **Dependency additions** that aren't justified in the description. A new
  runtime dependency needs a reason a one-file helper wouldn't have solved.
- **No response for 14 days** on review feedback. Reopen whenever you're ready;
  nothing is lost.

None of this is aimed at first-timers. A small, focused, well-evidenced PR from
someone who has never contributed before gets reviewed ahead of a big one from
someone who has.

## Project layout

| Path | What lives there |
|---|---|
| `src/main/` | Electron main process — PTYs (`pty.ts`), fs/git bridges, the hive (`hive.ts`, `hooks.ts`, `memory.ts`), config. |
| `src/preload/` | Context-bridge IPC surface. |
| `src/renderer/` | React UI, Pixi.js office scene (`scene/office/`), components, design system, stores. |
| `tools/mapgen/` | Python helpers for building/rendering the Tiled office map. |

See [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](./docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the data-flow overview,
the module by module layout, and the design system.

## Good first areas

- **Wiring real Claude Code hook events** — avatar behavior is currently driven
  by a mock event loop (`src/renderer/src/store/mockEvents.ts`). Replacing it
  with real tool events is the headline next milestone.
- The add-agent flow and config drawer.
- Cross-platform smoke-testing — Windows and Linux builds ship, but real-world
  coverage (WSL2, various distros, uncommon shells) is thin.

## Commit & PR conventions

- Branch off `main`. One change per PR — see
  [What gets a PR closed](#what-gets-a-pr-closed).
- Write a clear description of *what* changed and *why*. We can read the diff;
  we cannot read your reasoning.
- Say how you tested it, and on which OS. "Tested locally" tells us nothing.
- Link the issue you're fixing: `Closes #123`.
- Don't commit `node_modules/`, `out/`, or built artifacts (already gitignored).
- Don't force-push after a review has started. It throws away the comparison the
  reviewer was working from.
- **Never put credentials, tokens, internal metrics, or customer data in a
  commit message.** A pushed commit message is public and permanent, and no
  later rewrite retracts it once it has been fetched.

## A note on assets

The bundled tilesets are LimeZu's *Modern Interiors*, used under the **Complete
Version licence**. See [`ATTRIBUTION.md`](./src/renderer/src/assets/ATTRIBUTION.md).
That licence requires credit to LimeZu, so don't remove the acknowledgement from
the README, the app, or the website. The Office cast is drawn procedurally in
`portraitArt.ts` and carries no third-party licence.
If you contribute new art, it must be either your own work or compatibly
licensed, and you must add it to `ATTRIBUTION.md`. Don't add unlicensed assets.
